# SpookySkeletons
A small Minecraft plugin that adds "Boss" skeletons.

One of my first full plugins, doesn't have much more than just randomly spawning "Boss" skeletons. 

The boss skeletons have a range of special arrows, some potion effect based arrows and others are mob spawning arrows. 
They drop a range of items when dead, these items are tier based, so depending on chance you could get a tier 1 set of items or a tier 2 -> there isn't many items right now,
the current ones are there just to test it all works properly.

MAY be updated in the future.

Feel free to clone and change this yourself.
