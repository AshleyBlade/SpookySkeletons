# SpookySkeletons
A small Minecraft plugin that adds "Boss" skeletons.

One of my first full plugins, doesn't have much more than just randomly spawning "Boss" skeletons. 

The boss skeletons have a range of special arrows, some potion effect based arrows and others are mob spawning arrows. 
They drop a range of items when dead, these items are tier based, so depending on chance you could get a tier 1 set of items or a tier 2 -> there are not many items right now,
the current ones are there just to test it all works properly.

The skeletons also have a damage resistance to players of 75%, this means all damage dealt by players is reduced to 25% of initial damage. I may implement a special tool functionality in the future, where a select few weapons with certain criteria can do more full or more damage to these Boss skeletons.

I might also create a custom Boss Skeleton mob, instead of changing the default ones. This mob would be able to have more advanced features like larger health pool, follower minions and more!

This MAY be updated in the future.

Feel free to clone and change this yourself.
